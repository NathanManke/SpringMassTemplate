Hello

I believe I implemented everything successfully.

Despite this, my simulation does not look alike to the example video.
This seems to be a problem that many other students observe too..

But I followed the spring equations as they were presented. 
So perhaps there's another force I am not considering?
In the slides there's an equation that includes -kd * velocity
but this would oppose movement, leading me to believe it's "drag"
and that would not explain why my cubes are less bouncy instead of more.

I played around a bit and found that adding 0.14f * velocity to the force equation
made it very close to the example video.. but there was no real basis for this so I removed it.

Everything seems about right otherwise. :)
